## Educational disclaimer

The Rock Rankers API is a made-up project for learning. @drenn08 is the project subject
matter expert. @GillWrites is the technical writer. The course was a University of
Washington course about API documentation.

This API shows how to use REST calls to manage rock music rankings. The Rock Rankers
service runs on a local JSON server. See [Getting Started](./Tutorials/rock-rankers%20environment%20set-up.md) for setup instructions.
