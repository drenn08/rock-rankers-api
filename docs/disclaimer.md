## Educational disclaimer

The Rock Rankers API is a made-up project for learning with the University of Washington,
specializing in API documentation. @drenn08 is the project subject matter expert.
@GillWrites is the technical writer.

This API shows how to use REST calls to manage rock music rankings. The Rock Rankers
service runs on a local JSON server. See [Getting Started](get-started.md) for setup instructions.
